### RockPaperScissors Game
**This is a full-stack application created with React on the frontend and express with socket.io on the backend**

### Description
I've chosen typescript due to static typing. The game lets you choose between two modes. Best of one and also the best of three. I've also implemented a timer, when a player doesn't make a choice, the game will pick randomly.

When two players choose the same mode, then they will be put into one room to play togheter. When one player quits the game, then the another player will be directly redirected to another page.
