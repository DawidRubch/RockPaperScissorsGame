### RockPaperScissors Game
**This is a full-stack application created with React on the frontend and express with socket.io on the backend**

### Description
I've chosen typescript due to static typing. The game lets you choose between two modes. Best of one and also the best of three. I've also implemented a timer, when a player doesn't make a choice, the game will pick randomly.
